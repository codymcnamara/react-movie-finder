Movie Finder
========

A web app for finding your favorite movie. [Live link](https://codymcnamara.github.io/react-movie-finder/).

Built with React, TypeScript, and React Query.

Coding highlights:

*   Uses temporary caching of API responses with React Query, resulting in a faster UI.
*   Connects to external "TMDB" API service to provide up to date movie information.
*   Uses React Router "loader" to fetch data before component renders.
